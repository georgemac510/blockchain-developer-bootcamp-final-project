# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
This is my final project submission for the Consensys Academy Bootcamp 2021.

<h1>Legal Document Form Repository</h1>

The Legal Document Form Repository will be a datastore and marketplace to purchase common filable-PDF legal documents such as a simple will, articles of incorporation for specific states or provinces, bill of sale sample, building contract, business plan, etc. Users will be able to purchase and download the filable-PDF using testnet Ethereum or Polygon tokens. If time permits, it may be nice to store the documents on IPFS and users would be able to retrieve the documents with an IPFS hash after their payment is confirmed. 

TO DO LIST:
1) Update .css and improve colors/visual aesthetics
2) Update README.md
3) Deploy website on Render or Surge?  DONE https://legaldoc.surge.sh/
4) Prep for video/screencast
